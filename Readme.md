# Goal

DeformerRuns is a 20 second Unity timeline movie using keenanwoodall's Deformer

# Details

keenanwoodall's Deformer is a fun way to play with timeline.

My 5 year old son played the voice of blue pill. I'm red pill. An *.mp4 of the results can be found in https://github.com/Feddas/DeformerRuns/releases . Found about Deformer from a reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/ekogd1/i_added_an_experimental_elasticity_feature_to_my/

# Tools

- Deformer - Mesh twisting and bouncing https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/ekogd1/i_added_an_experimental_elasticity_feature_to_my/
- Timeline - animation scheduler
- Unity Recorder - Builds from UnityEditor to *.MP4's https://unitytech.github.io/unity-recorder/manual/index.html
